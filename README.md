# CS612_JamesGabberty_HW5
James Gabberty's assignment 5 with Docker, Node js, and Mongo source code.               
This web service, that was made using Node.js, and backed up with a Mongo database, can be used to add, view, and delete baseball players. By clicking on the player's name, a box on the left hand side will appear that will show information about the player in greater detail. By navigating to /users/userlist, the raw data in JSON format can be seen. For the service to properly work, the Node.js and MongoDB must be up and running, as offered by Docker. The tutorial that was used can be found here: http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2014/restful-web-app-node-express-mongodb/
I used the framework that the tutorial created and edited it to create my own collection of information relative to baseball players. 
Please note, included in the Github repository is the screencast of my web server running.
