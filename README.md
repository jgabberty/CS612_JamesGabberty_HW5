# CS612_JamesGabberty_HW5
James Gabberty's assignment 5 with Docker, Node js, and Mongo source code.               
This web service, that was made using Node.js, and backed up with a Mongo database, can be used to add, view, and delete baseball players. By clicking on the player's name, a box on the left hand side will appear that will show information about the player in greater detail. By navigating to /users/userlist, the raw data can be seen. The tutorial that was used can be found here: http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2014/restful-web-app-node-express-mongodb/
I used the framework that the tutorial created and edited it to create my own collection of information relative to baseball players.
